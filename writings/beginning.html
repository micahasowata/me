            If you go to my Github you would find that I created it on the 30th
            of october 2021. But when you check the activity chart you would see
            it empty up till the 24th of December of 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well that’s because while I have experimented with programming since
            2021 I only decided to take it seriously on the 23rd of December
            2025.
          </p>
          <p>Why?</p>
          <p>
            Ever since I started writing code, I have always known that my
            projects were comparatively trash. It was mostly just lazy, not well
            thought through modifications to tutorials and I wanted to improve.
            But I didn’t know what the changing process would look like and I
            had a massive ego because I did not want to look unserious in front
            of the people I was interacted with so I constantly put off
            relearning and pushed through terribly written projects and
            consoling myself that I am just a beginner.
          </p>
          <p>
            October 20th 2023, I moved to Ireland from Nigeria. In that period I
            realized that a new class of opportunities were open to me. I wasn’t
            in school or working, just at home with the programming skills from
            Nigeria so I cleared my Github and decided to re-do the tutorials in
            some kind of “new location, new Micah” move. It felt good to do so.
            I had time, electricity and fast internet and I was breezing through
            the tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the underlying lack of knowledge, lack of curiosity, fear of the
            unknown, was still there and once again my projects were
            modifications of the tutorials. I could not think of anything new or
            I stopped myself from thinking of anything new or ambitious. I
            wanted to change that.
          </p>
          <p>
            In mid 2024, I was informed that I would be able to start college in
            September of 2025. I chose to study Computer Science but I knew that
            I had math skills that didn’t belong even in a high school classroom
            and I needed to improve or I would be struggling from day one.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I paused programming, picked up OpenStax Prealgebra and took a
            deep dive. I had nobody to prove anything to. I was in a new
            country, new continent, no friends so motion was easy. When I got
            into my first college mathematics in October of 2025 and I found
            myself being able to say “I know this topic” I felt proud of myself.
            Extremely proud.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to immediately do the same for my programming. But I paused
            to get used to the pacing of college. It is fast. I made a few
            friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the 23rd of December, I randomly started thinking of my life. I
            am 19. The work I do in the next 5 years would probably dictate
            where I would spend my 20s. Where I spend my 20s would determine to
            a not-so-minor extent the direction of my life. I want a life that I
            would be happy to look back at when I am old.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current goal is to intern at a company in San Francisco or New
            York in 2028.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am starting over from scratch and rebuilding my programming skills
            just like I did my maths skills so that one summer day in 2028 I
            would stand in Times Square or the Golden Gate Bridge and feel just
            I felt in my first college mathematics class.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have beng seeing Zig and Bun and I love the idea of very fast +
            very easy to use tools so I want to build mine. A statically typed
            language that can be a substitute for pseudocode. It would great for
            following books like Introduction to Algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently in chapter 4 of Programming -- Principles and
            Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup. After it I
            would move to The Algorithm Design Manual, 3rd Edition by Steven
            Skiena. Then I am going to dive into Robert Nystrom’s Crafting
            Interpreters.
          </p>
          <p>It’s hard work but I am going to do it.</p>
