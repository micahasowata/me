summary: "Quick intro to the process for learning Java"
---

In my [previous post](/posts/learning-and-headaches) I stated that I would be learning Java, primarily because I want to read the Crafting Interpreters book and I did not want to have to translate Java into Go.

My brain is not a compiler ðŸ˜‚.

I would continue using Core Java for the Impatient. The reason my head hurt is not because of the book, it was the result of mixture of tiredness and skipping meals.

All that has been fixed so I am ready dive in and learn about Java.

This is the pilot post in a series of post to document my learning journey. I currently don't have a feature for managing series and to be honest I am not thinking about implementing it but that should not be an issue.

Each post in th series would be very easy to follow. Pure conversational English with a lot of bullet lists and some code snippets if appropriate.

It would just be me jotting points that I am gathering from reading the book.

Java here I come.
