This going to be covering the basic structures and control flows, and their syntax in Java real quick to get it out of the way.
I just tried setting up Google's Java formatter but I don't think it is working, so I am skipping it to concentrate on the book.

- There are three types of comments.
  ```java
  // Single line comments

  /*
    Multi line comments
  */

  /**
    Doc comments
  */
  ```

- Compilation and running happens sequentially:
  1. The compiler, `javac` converts source code in byte code stored in a `.class` file
  2. The runner, `java` creates a virtual machine then executes the byte code in that virtual machine.
The byte code generated by `javac` can be run anywhere.

- The `JShell` command opens up a REPL interface on the terminal for quickly trying out things with Java.

- There primitive (non objects) types consisting of:
  1. Four signed (can hold positive and negative values) integer; `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
  2. Two floating point types: `float` and `double`
  3. `char` that holds single characters
  4. `boolean` that holds two values `true` or `false`

- Every primitive has a corresponding object type.

- `long` values are suffixed with `L` like
  ```java
  var humansOnEarth = 8_000_000_000L;

  /* The underscores are valid. They are treated like comments.*/
  ```

- `float` values are suffixed with `F` like
  ```java
  var pi = 3.142F; // Without the F it becomes a double
  ```

- `char` values have a corresponding integer value e.g `'J'` has the integer value of `74`

- Variables can be declared in several ways
  ```java
  int zero = 0;
  var zero = 0; // has type int.
  var zero = 0, one; // one is uninitialized, so it shouldn't be used.
  one = 1; // one has been initialized. It can be used from this point forward.
  ```

- Identifiers can contain any letter and digit (non-Latin letters are accepted) and the symbols: `$` and `_`. `$` is generally used for auto generated code while `_` can stand alone as an identifier.

- You cannot have spaces in your identifiers and you cannot use any of the keywords as an identifier. Identifiers are conventionally written in `camelCase`

- The `final` keyword makes a variable constant.
  ```java
  final int BMW_M5_HP = 727;
  ```

- Arithemetic operators work as usual. Don't divide by zero.

- Use the `Math` class for any calculation that you care about.

- When an operation happens between two numeric:
  1. If one of them is a `double` the other is converted and the result is a `double`
  2. If one of them is a `float` the other is converted and the result is a `float`
  3. If one of them is a `long` the other is converted and the result is a `long`

- To cast a number from type A to type B e.g `int` to `char`the syntax is
  ```java
  var x = (char) 75; //  should produce K
  ```

- All relational operators work as usual. There's even ternary.

- When you care deeply about the accuracy of a calculation more than performance of the operation use `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` classes. They are the best.

- Strings are object of class `String`.

- Convert numbers to and from strings require use of thier corresponding object types.

- I/O with the terminal is best handle using the `System` and `Scanner` classes

- `if` works as usual.

- `switch` works as usual.

- `for`, `while` and `do/while` loops work as expected.

- Variables declared **within** a method or loop is scoped to that method or loop. They cannot be referenced from outside the loop or method.

- Arrays are sequences of items of a single type, whose length is known at compile time. They are created with the syntax:
  ```java
  String[] names = {"Bill", "Joy"}
  ```

- Use an `ArrayList` to create arrays that have dynamic lengths.
  ```java
  var engineers = new ArrayList<String>();
  engineers.add("Bill Joy");
  engineers.add("Steve Jobs");

  engineers.remove("Steve Jobs");
  ```

- To create an array list of a primitive type use the corresponding class

- There is an enchanced `for` loop that simplifies the `for` loop structure for easier readability.

- Variables store reference to objects and other non primitive structures not the values themselves so when copying a non primitive variable you are only getting a copy of the reference rather than the actual values themselves.

- Methods are functions that describe what an object of a class can do.

- Variable arguments are basically just arrays.
