This is a summary of what I learnt in Chapter One of Core Java for the Impatient.

They are also pointers for topics to research more about as you try to learn Java.


## Comments
There are three types of code comments in Java:

1. Single line comments
  ```java
    // Every thing from here till the end of this line is ignored by the compiler.
  ```

2. Multi line comments
  ```java
    /*
      Once you start writing multiple single line comments it would be best to switch to multi line because they reduce
      repetition.
    */
  ```

3. Documentation comments
  ```java
    /**
      Once comments become manuals rather than notes to your future self, this is your best buddy.
    */
  ```

## Compilation
Java is a compiled language, which implies that there is a compilation process. It is a multi-stage process that involves:
  1. Converting the source code stored in `.java` files into bytecode (a platform independent intermediate language format that can be run anywhere there's a Java Virtual Machine) using a command like this:

  ```sh
  javac path/to/srcFile.java
  ```

  The generated bytecode is stored in `.class` files.

  2. The bytecode is then run in the Java Virtual Machine (a piece of software that can convert bytecode into platform specific machine code) using the command:

  ```sh
  java path/to/byteFile  # Notice that there are no extensions at the end of the path.
  ```

If you have a JDK installed and you just want to play around with some Java, run the command `jshell` on your terminal. It opens a REPL interface that encourages quick hacking.

## Types
- Java is object oriented but there are variable types that are not objects. These are: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`,
`float`, `double`, `char` and `boolean`

- Every primitive has a corresponding object type so there are: `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Character`, `Boolean`.

- For 90% of your Java usage you would most likely be using: `int` and `Integer`, a little `long` and `Long`, `double` and `Double`, and `boolean` and `Boolean`,

- `long` values must be suffixed with `L` like
  ```java
  var humansOnEarth = 8_000_000_000L;

  // The underscores are to improve readability they are treated just like comments.
  ```

- `float` values must be suffixed with `F` like
  ```java
  var pi = 3.142F; // Without the F it becomes a double
  ```

- `char` values must be within single quotes.
  ```java
  var j = 'J'; // Double quotes makes them strings.
  ```

- Strings are objects of class `String` which means they are a non-primitve type.
  ```java
    var name = "Micah Asowata"; // type is String.
  ```

## Variables
- There are several ways to declare and initialize a variable
  1. Statically set the type.

  ```java
  int zero = 0;
  ```

  2. Infer the type.
  ```java
  var zero = 0;
  ```

  3. Declare now, initialize later.
  ```java
  int one;
  one = 1;
  ```

- A variable cannot be used before it is initialized. It is a compile time error.

- Scoping rules work as expected.

- The `final` keyword makes a variable constant which means that its value cannot be changed after it is initialized.
  ```java
    final int BMW_M5_HP = 727;
  ```

- Identifiers can contain any letter and digit (non-Latin letters are accepted) and the symbols: `$` and `_`. `$` is generally used for auto generated code while `_` can stand alone as an identifier.

- Identifiers cannot have spaces and must not be keywords.

- Identifiers are conventionally written in `camelCase`

## Casting and Conversion
- When converting from smaller number to larger number the conversion is implicit because no information would be lost.
  ```java
    // int -> double
    // short -> int
    // byte -> short
  ```

- When information can be lost types have to be casted.
  ```java
    var x = (char) 75; //  casting from int to char. should produce K
  ```

- Converting between numbers and strings requires use of their corresponding class.
  ```java
    // String to int
    var iage = Integer.parseInt("42");

    // int to String
    var sage = Integer.toString(iage);
  ```

## Arithemetic Operators
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` work as expected.

- When an operation happens between two numeric types:
  1. If one of them is a `double` the other is converted and the result is a `double`
  2. If one of them is a `float` the other is converted and the result is a `float`
  3. If one of them is a `long` the other is converted and the result is a `long`

- Use the `Math` class for any calculation that you care about.
  ```java
    System.out.println(Math.pow(2, 2)); // prints 4.
  ```

- When you care deeply about the accuracy of a calculation more than performance of the operation use `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` classes

## Standard I/0
- The `System` class handles standard output
  ```java
  System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // outputs Hello, World! to the terminal
  ```

- To read from standard input
  ```java
    // import java.util.Scanner;
    var in = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("How old are you?");
    var name = in.nextInt();
    in.close();
  ```

## Control flow
- `if` works as usual.
  ```java
    if (x != 0) {
        //...
    }

    // Condition must be a boolean
  ```

- `switch` works as usual.

- `for`, `while` and `do/while` loops work as expected.

- There is an enchanced `for` loop that simplifies the `for` loop structure for easier readability.
  ```java
    int[] ages = {2, 5, 8, 19};

    for (int age: ages) {
        age += age;
    }
  ```

## Arrays and ArrayLists
- Arrays are sequences of items of a single type, whose length is known at compile time. They are created with the syntax:
  ```java
  String[] names = {"Bill", "Joy"}
  ```

- Use an `ArrayList` to create arrays that have dynamic lengths.
  ```java
  var engineers = new ArrayList<String>();
  engineers.add("Bill Joy");
  engineers.add("Steve Jobs");

  engineers.remove("Steve Jobs");
  ```

- To create an array list of a primitive type use the corresponding class
  ```java
  var ages = new ArrayList<Integer>();
  ages.add(42)
  ```

- Variable arguments are basically just arrays.
  ```java
    public static void main(String... args) {

    }
  ```

## Methods
- Methods are functions that describe what an object of a class can do.
  ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
  ```
