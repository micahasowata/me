This is an intro object oriented programming, the way of Java.

## Classes
- A `class` is a blueprint for an object. It determines the state and behavior of an object.
  ```java
    public class Car {

    }
  ```

- Classes must be located in a file that shares the same name
  ```java
    // Athlete.java

    public class Athlete {

    }
  ```

- There are inner classes

## Objects
- An `object` is an instance of a class.
  ```java
    var runner = new Athlete();
  ```

### State and Behavior
- Methods handle the behaviour of an object i.e what an object can do.

- `accessor` methods allows the object to carry out task without modifying the state of the invoking object.
  ```java
    //...Athlete

    public Athlete compete() {
        var a = new Athlete()
        a.isCompeting = true;
        return a
    }
  ```

- `accessor` methods are safer for concurrent access as they just return a new object with the neccessary parts altered.

- `mutator` methods change the state of the invoking object.
  ```java
    //...Athlete

    public void addRecord() {
        this.records += 1; // this refers to the current object.
    }
  ```

- When there are more than one method with the same name but different parameter lists, the method is regarded as overloaded. e.g `System.out.println` method.

- Instance variables hold the state of an object. They are `private` meaning only methods in that class can access them.
  ```java
    //...Athlete
    private int records = 0;
  ```

## References
- Variables hold references to an object
  ```java
    var toyota = new Car();
    var lexus = toyota;

    // There are two valid references to a car object.
  ```

- `null` means a variable is not referencing any object. Don't call any methods on a `null` object.

## Pass by Value
- All parameters are passed by value which means that everywhere a value is needed a copy of that value is given.
  ```java
    public void increaseByTwo(double val) {
        return val += 2;
    }

    var y = 5.0;

    var z = increaseByTwo(y);

    /*
        y remains 5.0

        z is 7.0
    */
  ```

## Constructors
- Constructors are "methods" used to create a new instance of a class.
  ```java
  var volvo = new Car(); // Car() is the default constructor.
  ```

- Constructors can also be overloaded.
  ```java
    //...Athlete
    public Athlete(String sport) {
        this.sport = sport;
        this.name = "";
    }

    public Athlete(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sport = "";
    }
  ```
  ```java
    public void addRecord() {
        this.records += 1;
    }
  ```

- Once a class has a custom constructor, it loses its default constructor

## Records
- A record is a special type of class that is less verbose to setup and manage.

- There are three types of record constructors: *canonical*, *custom* and *compact*.
  ```java
  // Point.java
        ----- // canonical constructor
        |
  record Point(double x, double y) {
    public Point { --|
        x *= 2;      |--- // compact constructor
        y *= 3;      |
    }              --|

    public Point() { -|
        x = 0;        |--- // custom constructor
        y = 0;        |
    }                -|
  }
  ```

- A *compact* constructor simply acts as the body of the *custom* constructor.

## Modifiers
- `public` means a variable/method is available to any class that calls it.

- `private` means a variable/method is available to just the class that created it.

- `static` variables belong to the class and are shared by all objects of that class e.g `System.out`

- `static` methods don't need an object to be invoked. e.g `Math.pow`

- `static` methods cannot access instance variables of the class they belong to but they can access its static variables.

- A factory method is a static method that creates a new instance of a class.

## Packaging rules
- A `package` is a group of related java files. Its name must unique and must be declared as the first line of any class that are contained in it.
  ```java
    //Athlete.java

    package com.facebook;
  ```

- A package name may conform to the directory tree of the `.java` files that it groups but it must be the directory of the `.class` files that belong to it.
  ```
  /*
    Athlete.java may be in sports/personnel/Athlete.java
    Athlete.class MUST be in com/facebook/Athlete.class
  */
  ```

- `jar` is used to group packages for distribution

- A source file can have multiple classes but only one, whose name is the same as the file's, can be `public`

## Imports
- To import a class from another package
  ```java
    import java.util.Random;
  ```

- Import all classes of a package using the `*`
  ```java
  import java.util.*;
  ```

- Import all the static methods of class using `import static`
  ```java
    import static java.lang.Math;
  ```
