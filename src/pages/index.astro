    <h1>Hi, I am Micah Asowata.</h1>
    <p>
      I am an engineer with current focus on web based products and tooling. I
      always aim to deliver excellent products so that I would have no reason to
      echo Leonardo Da Vinci's last words:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I have offended God and mankind because my work did not reach the quality
      it should have
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You can go through my <a href="/projects">projects</a> to see what I have built
    </p>

      If you are here to see my writings you can click <a href="/posts">here.</a
